# Coursera_GenomicDataSci_Captone

## 1. This .pdf file is submitted as the last Assginment for the last ("Captone") of 8 courses in the Specialization of Genomic Data Science offerred by JHU on Coursera. 

## 2. The file is to contain all the information necessary to reproduce the results from working on a real bioinformatics problem.

## 3. The project is to reanalyze either 6 or 12 raw RNA-seq data from the Fetal and Adult groups in Jaffe et al (2014) which contains the pipeline of RNA-Seq. In addition, the Gene Set Analysis is specifically targeted to the association of H3K4me3 modification to the promoter sequences in differentially expressed cortical genes between the two groups.

## 4. Only 6 samples (3 from each group) were included in this analysis. As many output and/or results are included for direct and convenient comparisons. 

## 5. The lack of any overlapped sequences between H3K4me3 peaks and differential promoters is of notice and requires further trouble-shooting.
